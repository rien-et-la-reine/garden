# garden
a split 56 key columnar stagger keyboard with a tentable thumb cluster [WIP]
ZMK support using nice!nano v2: https://github.com/rien-et-la-reine/garden-path

*note: do NOT disconnect trrs connectors while power on, the way they are used here won't short VCC to ground or anything, but will short some columns/rows with each other which could be potentially damaging
